# If-Else:
📖**Read:**
<p>
  If-Else is a conditional statement used to execute boolean expressions(true, false). This conditional statement is divided into two parts,
  If condition- which is executed when the condition evaluates to true and Else- which is executed when the condition is false
</p>

🎯**Code Example:**

```
// Number Compare:
void main(){
  var number = 58;  
  if(number > 30){
    print("$number is more than 30");
  }else{
    print("$number is less than 30");
  }  
}
```

❗**Exercises:**

Suppose, you have grades including 
-[
1. A+ for number>80
2. A for 80>number>=60
3. A- for 60>number>=40
4. B for 40>number>=33
5. F for 33>number
]

make a program using if-else statement and print grades.
